# Bomb_Manual
 This is the Bomb Manual for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes Vanilla (No Mods)
 The program is a variant of the original Bomb Manual (http://www.bombmanual.com/) that provides a quick way to solve each module.

### Traits Tab
Displays options to toggle the important indicators "FRK" and "CAR", whether there's a parallel port on the bomb, a place to input the number of batteries, and whether the Serial Number contains a vowel and last digit odd number. The batteries TextField does not accept non-number values.

### Button Tab
There's a section for the label of the button and one for the color. Press one in each to view the results

### Keypad Tab
Clicking a keypad will highlight that keypad in a cyan background for easy location. Click 4 of them to get the correct order

### Simple Wires Tab
The tab contains a slider with the current number of wires

### Simon Says Tab

### Who's On First Tab

### Memory Tab

### Morse Code Tab
Only reads dots and dashes in the input field (- and .) and outputs possible words in the TextArea
**[Module not finished, needs correction and testing]**

### Complicated Wires Tab
Input a letter sequence for each wire and the output will display what that wire is and whether to cut it or not. Be sure to check the sides of the bomb for parallel port, batteries and the serial number.
r - Wire has red coloring
b - Wire has blue coloring
s - Wire has a star underneath
l - Wire has a lit LED
w - Wire is completely bare (But we all know that you cut that wire)

### Wires Sequences Tab

### Mazes Tab

### Password Tab
Contains 5 input fields to take in the sets of letters in each row. Input the set of letters into the corresponding input and the Output area displays the possible passwords.

### Knobs Tab
Displays the orientations for each knob from the original manual, nothing fancy.
